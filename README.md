# Alien vs. Zombie

Alien vs. Zombie is a simplified, text-based version program that was inspired from the game Alien Path with several modifications of our own. In this program, the user navigates an alien on a path to destroy zombies. It combines several elements of role-playing game, path-planning, puzzle, and strategy.
